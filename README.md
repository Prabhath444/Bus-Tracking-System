# 🚍 GPS Bus Tracking System - Laravel API

This repository contains the source code for the **RESTful backend API** of the **SLGPS Bus Tracking System**.  
This powerful and secure API is built with **Laravel** and is designed to serve a decoupled frontend application, such as a **React SPA**.

The API provides a complete solution for managing a fleet of buses, drivers, routes, and schedules, and includes **real-time GPS location tracking** with automated alert generation.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**  
  Token-based authentication for users powered by Laravel Sanctum.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Utilizes Laravel Gates to ensure that only users with appropriate roles (e.g., *Admin*, *Manager*) can perform sensitive actions.

- **Full CRUD Functionality**  
  Comprehensive, secure endpoints for managing all core resources: *Users, Buses, Drivers, Routes, and Schedules.*

- **Real-Time GPS Tracking**  
  A dedicated endpoint to receive live location pings from GPS devices and endpoints to provide the latest location data for a live map.

- **Automated Alerting**  
  The system automatically generates **Overspeed** alerts when a bus reports a speed exceeding a configurable limit.

- **Device Authentication**  
  A custom middleware provides secure authentication for IoT/GPS devices using a static API key.

- **Dashboard Analytics**  
  A single endpoint to retrieve high-level statistics for the admin dashboard.

- **Optimized Responses**  
  Uses Laravel API Resources to transform and format all JSON responses, ensuring a clean and consistent data structure for the frontend.

## 🖥️ Frontend Integration

This API is designed to be consumed by a **Single Page Application (SPA)**.  
The recommended frontend is a **React application** that uses the following architecture:

- **API Client**  
  Axios is used for all HTTP requests. A central `apiClient` instance is configured with the base URL of the API.

- **Authentication Flow**  
  1. The React app sends user credentials to the `/api/login` endpoint.  
  2. Upon success, the received **Bearer Token** is stored in the browser’s `localStorage` for session persistence.  
  3. The central `apiClient` instance is dynamically configured to include the header:  
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <token>
     ```
     on all subsequent requests.

- **State Management**  
  A global React Context (`AuthContext`) manages the user's authentication state (`user`, `token`, `loading`), making it accessible to all components.

- **Protected Routes**  
  `react-router-dom` is used for routing. A custom `ProtectedRoute` component wraps all sensitive pages, automatically redirecting unauthenticated users to the sign-in page.
